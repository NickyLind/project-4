// first I will create a database-like object called 'Database' that holds objects called orders,
//and IDs so that i can go back and pick out orders by their IDs. Next I will create an object called 
// 'Orders' that will store one or more Pizza objects i create so people can order multiple pizzas.
// Next I will create a pizza object that will allow users to create a base pizza style, size, and 
// additional toppings. I will use a prototype for 'Database' called assignOrderId to add an id to 
// each order. I will use a prototype for 'Database' called addOrder to add an Order object into
// the database. I will create an Order prototype called addPizza to add pizzas to an order.
// I will create a Pizza prototype called customPizza to add sizes and toppings to pizzas.
// I will create arrays for topping tiers. I will assign a price to each tier of toppings and 
// loop through these arrays to add dollar values each time a topping in each tier is selected
// I will create an if statement for pizza sizes that adds or subtracts from a 'medium' pizza for 
// different sizes
